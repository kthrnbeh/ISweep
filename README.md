Cleans videos by using remote capabilities. 
Prompt:
Help me design and develop a world-class app that uses AI algorithms and machine learning to edit videos in real time. The app should function like an advanced remote control, allowing users to:

Automatically mute specific words (e.g., profanity)

Skip or fast-forward specific actions/scenes (e.g., sexual content)

Apply user-defined settings to customize filters

Learn and improve filtering accuracy over time

The system must make the playback appear seamlessly edited without altering the original video file. Provide a detailed plan covering architecture, AI model selection, real-time video/audio processing, and user interface design.

Core Objectives:

Real-Time AI Filtering:

Detect and mute specific spoken words (e.g., profanity) automatically.

Identify and skip or fast-forward predefined actions/scenes (e.g., sexual content).

Adaptive Learning:

Implement machine learning models that improve detection accuracy over time based on user feedback.

Allow customization so each user can define their own filtering criteria.

Non-Destructive Playback:

Edits must happen during playback without altering the original file.

Output should appear as if the video was pre-edited, with smooth transitions and no jarring skips.

System Requirements:

Cross-platform compatibility (TV, desktop, mobile, streaming devices).

Low latency processing for seamless viewing.

Intuitive, user-friendly interface for defining filters and reviewing edit logs.

Deliverables:

Detailed system architecture

Recommended AI/ML models and training data approaches

Real-time audio/video processing pipeline design

User interface wireframes and feature flow

Suggestions for technology stack and deployment strategy
